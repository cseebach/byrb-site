        <h1 id="the-philosophy">The Philosophy</h1>

<p>The <em>Build Your Running Body</em> training approach is based upon a simple premise: <strong>If you want to become a better runner, you must begin by building a better running body.</strong></p>

<p>And how do we do that?</p>

<p>Just as weightlifters target muscle groups, we runners need to target the individual components of our running body. Specificity in training is the key to running fitness.</p>

<p>Some of our running components are easy to identify: muscles, nerves, connective tissue, and the cardiovascular system. Some are more elusive, like hormones and our brain’s regulation of effort.</p>

<p>Once a component is identified, we target it with a workout designed specifically to produce maximum improvement in that component.</p>

<p>By isolating each component, two things happen: We train the component to 100 percent of its potential, and we don’t waste energy overtraining our entire body in hopes of achieving the same effect. The result is a variety of workouts–from distance runs to speedwork to resistance training, plyometrics, and form drills–that maximizes the benefit of each training session and leads to top fitness and performance.</p>

<p>Improved running performance and whole-body fitness aren’t unsolved mysteries. Coaches, athletes, and exercise physiologists have been working on both for decades. The trick lies in utilizing advances in training to realize each runner’s personal fitness goals. While it’s tempting to embrace magic bullet solutions (to believe that success can be had by running barefoot, counting your strides, or embracing a fad diet), the truth is that your body is an incredibly complex biological machine with hundreds of working parts, and good training demands that you target all of them.</p>
